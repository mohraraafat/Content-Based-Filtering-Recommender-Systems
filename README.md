# Content-Based-Filtering-Recommender-Systems
Welcome! This project is all about building a **Content-Based Recommendation System** — one that understands *you* and your preferences to suggest relevant content like movies, books, articles, and more. No need for other users’ opinions — it's all about your own tastes. 🎧📚🎬

🚀 Key Features
✅ Clean and preprocess your content data
✅ Build user profiles based on their interactions
✅ Calculate item-to-item similarities
✅ Recommend content tailored to user preferences

⚙️ Setup Guide

1. Clone or download this repository
2. Create a virtual environment (recommended):
   `python -m venv venv`
   `source venv/bin/activate` (Windows: `venv\Scripts\activate`)
3. Install dependencies:
   `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Launch Jupyter Notebook:
   `jupyter notebook`

🧠 How to Use

1. Start with `data_preprocessing.ipynb` to clean and prepare your data
2. Run `content_similarity.ipynb` to compute similarities between items
3. Go to `user_profile_construction.ipynb` to build user taste profiles
4. Use `ranking_and_recommendation.ipynb` to generate top picks


💡 Final Output
You’ll get personalized recommendations based on user preferences, plus clear and attractive visualizations to understand them better.
